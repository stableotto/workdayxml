In this role for care management interventions, you will focus on improving care coordination and reducing the fragmentation of the services the recipients of care often experience, especially when multiple health care providers and different care settings are involved. Taken collectively, care management interventions are intended to enhance client safety, well-being, and quality of life. These interventions carefully consider health care costs through the professional care manager's recommendations of cost-effective and efficient alternatives for care. Thus, effective care management directly and positively impacts the health care delivery system, especially in realizing the goals of the \"Triple Aim,\" which include improving the health outcomes of individuals and populations, enhancing the experience of health care, and reducing the cost of care. The professional care manager performs the primary functions of assessment, planning, facilitation, coordination, monitoring, evaluation, and advocacy. Integral to these functions is collaboration and ongoing communication with the client, client's family or family caregiver, and other health care professionals involved in the client's care.\n\nWhy should you join the BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina family of companies? Other companies come and go, but for more than seven decades we\u2019ve been part of the national landscape, with our roots firmly embedded in the South Carolina community.
